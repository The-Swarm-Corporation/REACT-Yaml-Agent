A production-grade AI agent implementing the REACT (Reason + Act) methodology with YAML configuration and JSON tool interactions. Built with the Swarms framework and powered by advanced language models.

## üåü Features

### Intelligent Reasoning Framework
- Step-by-step reasoning process using REACT methodology
- Structured thought process with explicit reasoning, action, observation, and planning
- Dynamic adaptation to task complexity

### Tool Integration
- Seamless integration with external tools via JSON interface
- Built-in support for:
  - Calculator
  - Web Search
  - Weather API
  - Calendar Management
- Extensible architecture for custom tool addition

### Robust Error Handling
- Comprehensive error management system
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Fallback strategies for tool failures
- Clear error documentation and recovery paths

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarm_models import OpenAIChat

# Initialize the model
model = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=your_api_key,
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    temperature=0.1
)

# Create the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="REACT-Agent",
    system_prompt=REACT_PROMPT,
    llm=model,
    max_loops="auto",
    output_type="string",
    streaming_on=True,
    interactive=True
)

# Run a query
response = agent.run("Your query here")
```

## üí° Use Cases

### Financial Planning
```yaml
Example: "How can I establish a ROTH IRA to buy stocks and get a tax break?"

```

### Weather-Dependent Planning
```yaml
Example: "Should I plan a picnic for tomorrow?"
```

### Complex Calculations
```yaml
Example: "Calculate bulk order costs with tax"
```

### Schedule Management
```yaml
Example: "Find meeting times for team"
```

## üõ† Technical Architecture

### YAML Configuration
- Agent capabilities and behavior defined in YAML
- Clear, maintainable configuration structure
- Easy modification of agent parameters

### JSON Tool Interface
```json
{
  "tool_call": {
    "name": "tool_name",
    "parameters": {
      "param1": "value1",
      "param2": "value2"
    }
  }
}
```

## üîí Best Practices

1. **Explicit Reasoning**
   - Clear thought process documentation
   - Structured decision-making
   - Traceable logic flow

2. **Tool Usage**
   - Precise parameter specification
   - Documented tool calls
   - Error handling for each interaction

3. **Process Management**
   - Clear phase separation
   - Detailed observation recording
   - Explicit next steps planning

## üìä Performance Optimization

- Automatic loop management with `max_loops="auto"`
- Temperature control for consistent outputs
- Streaming support for real-time responses
